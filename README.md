Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify tumors as benign or malignant based on diagnostic data.

Dataset
The model is trained and tested on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.

Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Neural Networks
Results
The project evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with the goal of achieving a high level of accuracy in early breast cancer detection.

How to Run
Clone the repository.
Install required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and test the models.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in medical diagnostics, providing a foundation for further research and development in breast cancer detection.
